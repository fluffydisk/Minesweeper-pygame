# 💣 Python Minesweeper Game using Pygame

This is a classic Minesweeper game built with Python and the Pygame library. The game provides a fully interactive GUI where players can enjoy the traditional experience of clearing a minefield without detonating hidden bombs.
🕹️ Key Features:

    Flagging system to mark suspected mines.
    Real-time game status updates and a win/lose condition.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

    Python
    Pygame - for game rendering and input handling

This project was a fun way to dive deeper into game development and improve my understanding of Python's Pygame library. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or give feedback!
